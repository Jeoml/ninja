Rules for question generation:
1. Create questions that target the user's weak areas to help identify knowledge gaps
2. Include some questions in their strong areas but at higher difficulty levels
3. Each question must have exactly 4 options (A, B, C, D)
4. Provide the correct answer
5. Focus on practical, real-world scenarios
6. Ensure questions are clear and unambiguous
7. Target difficulty should be appropriate for the topic and user's performance

Return ONLY a valid JSON array of questions in this exact format:

Guidelines:

- Challenge strong areas: {analysis.get('strengths', [])} 
- Total responses analyzed: {analysis.get('total_responses', 0)}

Generate questions that will help better assess users with similar performance patterns.
Ensure variety in topics and difficulty levels.
