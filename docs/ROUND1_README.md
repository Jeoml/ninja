## Key Logic

### Topic Catalog Rules
- ‚úÖ **Solved**: Only correct answers for this topic
- ‚ùå **Unsolved**: Only incorrect answers for this topic  
- ‚úÖ **Mixed ‚Üí Solved**: Both correct AND incorrect answers (per requirement)

### Question Selection Strategy
1. **Priority 1**: Unattempted topics
2. **Priority 2**: Topics needing more attempts
3. **Priority 3**: Random from available pool
4. **Diversity**: Tries to cover different topics

### Performance Tracking
